## Internship Performance Evaluation

During my 12-week internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd.** (September 6, 2024 - December 24, 2024), I underwent a transformative journey from learning basic Cloud Computing concepts to successfully building a production-ready Serverless application on AWS.

### Project Overview

I participated in developing the **Travel Guide Application** - a travel journey sharing platform with a complete Serverless architecture, including:

**Technical Achievements:**
- Deployed AWS CloudFront for React apps (static & dynamic): distributing static assets (images, JS, CSS) and dynamic APIs.
- Built backend with Amazon S3 for file uploads: integrated pre-signed URLs from frontend to S3.
- Integrated AWS Location Service: added maps and place search to the app.
- Built serverless backend with Lambda: APIs and backend logic via Lambda functions.
- Configured IAM roles and policies: enforced least-privilege access for AWS services.
- Integrated AWS Rekognition and image processing: Rekognition analysis with SQS pipeline and SNS/SES notifications.
- End-to-end Cloud with Infrastructure as Code: used CloudFormation and SAM to deploy microservices automatically.

**Skills Developed:**
- React: proficient in building UI with hooks and component lifecycle.
- Tailwind CSS: rapid UI design with utility classes for responsive, flexible layouts.
- PostCSS: configured to optimize CSS and manage Tailwind utilities efficiently.
- JavaScript (ES6+): applied async/await, destructuring, arrow functions, modules for data handling and backend API integration.
- CI/CD and Docker: mastered CI/CD workflows, automated deployments, and containerized frontend/backend apps with Docker.
- Project tooling: used Git for source control and GitHub for project versioning.

**Soft Skills:**
- Effective teamwork in Agile environment
- Self-learning and rapid application of new technologies (from zero to production deployment in 12 weeks)
- Comprehensive documentation for team and end-users

### Evaluation Methodology

To objectively assess my internship performance, I use the criteria table below, reflecting both achievements and areas for improvement:

| No. | Criteria | Detailed Description & Evidence | Excellent | Good | Needs Improvement |
|-----|----------|--------------------------------|-----------|------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Technical Knowledge & Skills** | Proficient in AWS services (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, Rekognition), Infrastructure as Code (SAM/CloudFormation), Python/React. Successfully deployed production app with 15+ Lambda functions, 6 DynamoDB tables, AI processing pipeline. | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 2 | **Learning Speed & Adaptability** | From zero AWS knowledge to production deployment in 12 weeks. Self-taught SAM, Docker, multi-stack architecture. Resolved complex issues (CORS, cross-stack refs) without prior experience. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 3 | **Initiative & Creativity** | Self-researched and proposed multi-stack pattern for deployment optimization. Proactively debugged and fixed issues (CORS, IAM permissions). Independently wrote deployment automation scripts. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 4 | **Responsibility & Commitment** | Completed 12-week timeline with clear weekly deliverables. High code quality with proper error handling and logging. Comprehensive documentation for team. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 5 | **Discipline & Process** | Followed best practices (least privilege IAM, proper git workflow). Adhered to coding standards and security guidelines. Consistent daily progress tracking. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 6 | **Receptiveness to Feedback** | Applied feedback to improve architecture (transitioned from monolithic to multi-stack). Learned from code reviews and refactored accordingly. Need to improve proactively seeking feedback earlier. | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 7 | **Communication Skills** | Wrote detailed documentation (worklog, technical docs). Presented ideas clearly in team meetings. Need to improve explaining technical concepts to non-technical audience. | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 8 | **Teamwork** | Collaborated effectively with team members. Shared knowledge and supported colleagues. Contributed to code reviews and technical discussions. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 9 | **Professional Attitude** | Respected colleagues, deadlines, and commitments. Maintained positive attitude when facing challenges. Professional communication in all situations. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 10 | **Problem-Solving Mindset** | Successfully debugged complex issues (CORS, async processing, IAM). Implemented creative solutions (SQS pipeline, multi-stack). Analyzed trade-offs and made informed decisions. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 11 | **Actual Contribution** | Delivered production-ready application with full features. Created reusable infrastructure code. Documented lessons learned for future projects. Positive team feedback on code quality. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 12 | **Overall** | Exceeded expectations for intern position. Progressed from beginner to independently deploying and maintaining production AWS infrastructure. Ready for junior developer role. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |



### Conclusion

The 12-week internship has been a challenging yet rewarding journey. From knowing nothing about AWS, I successfully deployed a production application with complex architecture, demonstrating rapid learning ability and effective problem-solving skills.

What I'm most proud of is not just the technical skills acquired, but the mindset and approach to learning. I learned how to:
- Break down complex problems into manageable pieces
- Research effectively and apply knowledge quickly
- Work independently while collaborating well with the team
- Maintain quality standards even under pressure

I believe this foundation will help me continue growing as a software engineer and contribute effectively to any team in the future.
