### Week 5 Achievements

- Successfully designed the project's infrastructure architecture and proposed suitable reference templates for the team.
- Built a robust code skeleton with initial configuration files, establishing a strong foundation for the project.
- Registered and activated an AWS Skill Builder account, beginning to explore its courses and resources.
- Identified causes of abnormal costs: incomplete deletion of EC2 resources and lack of control over user accounts, leading to proposed cost optimization measures.
- Successfully integrated Axios and fetch API for handling HTTP requests in React.
- Learned how to handle CORS issues and apply proper error handling in API requests.
